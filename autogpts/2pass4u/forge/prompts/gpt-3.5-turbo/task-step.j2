Pay attention to details and make sure you accomplish exactly what the task above asks you to do, thus you have to be descriptive when using abilities and make sure that they will follow any constraints given above. If the task above has any examples of the format you can try also passing them to the abilities where it is appropriate.

Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Remember that you can manipulate texts and formats as you wish, your main goal is to accomplish the task given to you.

Remember that each ability is an extra point of failure, so try to use as little of them as possible.
